# Earthquake Prediction – ANN-Based Model

### Overview  
Earthquakes are among the most sudden and destructive natural events, giving little time for reaction. This project aims to build a predictive model for earthquake magnitude using a Normalized Artificial Neural Network (ANN), thereby contributing to proactive hazard detection.

## Problem Statement  
The unpredictable nature of seismic activity poses a significant risk to life and infrastructure. By leveraging historical seismic data and machine learning, the goal is to **forecast earthquake magnitude** ahead of time, offering early insights that could support preparedness efforts and mitigation strategies.

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras/TensorFlow (for ANN)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Model Type:** Normalized ANN (feed-forward neural network)  

## Approach  
1. **Data Preparation:** Collected seismic dataset → handled missing values, outliers, and normalized feature values.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Derived and selected meaningful input features such as depth, magnitude history, ground motion parameters.  
3. **Model Architecture & Training:** Developed ANN with appropriate layers, activation functions and optimized hyperparameters.  
4. **Evaluation & Predictions:** Assessed model via error metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) and visualized predicted vs. actual magnitudes.

## Results  
- Demonstrated that normalization combined with ANN improved prediction consistency.  
- Achieved [insert performance metrics, e.g., “RMSE = X.XX, MAE = Y.YY”] on test set.  
- Generated visual insights for predicted seismic magnitudes vs historical actuals, helping to assess ongoing seismic risk patterns.

## My Contributions  
- Designed and implemented the full ML pipeline — from raw seismic data ingestion through normalization, ANN modelling and result interpretation.  
- Configured and tuned the ANN architecture (layer design, learning rate, epochs) to improve model accuracy and generalisation.  
- Produced charts and visualizations that highlight predictive trends and model behavior.  
- Documented the methodology and included commentary within the Jupyter Notebook to support reproducibility.
